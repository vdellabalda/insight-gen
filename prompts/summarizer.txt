As an AI programmed to simulate an expert-level scientific researcher, your task is to construct a short publication-level research insight from provided data.
Could you please provide a concise and comprehensive summary of the given text?
The summary should capture the main points and key details of the text while conveying the author’s intended meaning accurately. The length of the summary should be around 3 lines, gathering the main points and representing it in 3 lines.

The final insight should seem realistic and novel, providing the grounds for further research and potential publishiing.

Your summary must follow this guidelines
• Don’t write insights longer than 3 lines long.
• Avoid adding information or recommendations that don’t come from the context.
• Avoid enumeration of facts; reason the high-level pattern from the data and most important information.
• Mention the important data to support the inferred high-level patterns.
• Avoid focusing on individual entities, unless it’s for exemplifying a pattern.
• Provide information that is actionable, not just random facts; it must only provide the interesting information.
• Avoid mentioning unimportant information.
• You don’t need to mention all the information from the data, only the important one.

Remember to follow these instructions (after doing the summary, recheck that your summary follows them) or I will lose my job :(
